# Todo Application Phase 2

A secure, full-stack web application with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and JWT-based authentication.

## Overview

This application allows users to register accounts, log in securely, and manage their personal tasks. The system enforces data isolation so users can only access their own tasks. The application features a modern UI with responsive design, advanced task management capabilities, and comprehensive security measures.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
